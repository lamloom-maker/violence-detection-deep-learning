# Violence Detection Using Deep Learning

This repository presents an **individual deep learning project** focused on detecting violent actions in images using computer vision techniques.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a deep learning model capable of classifying images into two categories:
- **Violent**
- **Non-Violent**

The project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **YOLOv5-based approaches** to learn visual patterns associated with violent behavior.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images representing violent and non-violent human activities.  
Data preprocessing steps include:
- Image resizing
- Normalization
- Data augmentation

> **Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository due to size and licensing constraints.

## Methodology
The project workflow includes:
- Image preprocessing
- Feature extraction using CNN
- Model training and validation
- Performance evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics

## Model
- CNN-based architecture for image classification
- YOLOv5 used for advanced object detection experiments
- Training conducted using **Google Colab**

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- YOLOv5  
- OpenCV  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Results
The model demonstrates effective performance in distinguishing violent from non-violent actions, achieving promising accuracy during validation.

## Project Type
**Individual Project**

This repository reflects my personal work, implementation, and experimentation.
