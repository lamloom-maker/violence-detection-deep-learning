# Violence Detection Using Deep Learning

This repository presents an individual deep learning project focused on detecting violent actions in images using computer vision techniques.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model capable of classifying images into:
- Violent
- Non-Violent

The project applies convolutional neural networks (CNN) and YOLO-based approaches to learn visual patterns associated with violence.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images representing violent and non-violent human activities.
Data preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

> Note: The dataset is not included in this repository due to size and licensing constraints.

## Methodology
The project workflow includes:
- Image preprocessing
- Feature extraction using CNN
- Model training and validation
- Performance evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics

## Model
- CNN-based architecture
- YOLOv5 used for advanced object detection experiments
- Training conducted using Google Colab

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- YOLOv5
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
The model demonstrates effective performance in distinguishing violent from non-violent actions, showing promising accuracy during validation.

## Project Type
**Individual Project**

This repository reflects my personal work, implementation, and experimentation.
